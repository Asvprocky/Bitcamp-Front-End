                "Always Strive and Prosper") is an American hip hop collective formed in 2006 in Harlem, New York
                City, that consists of rappers (most of whom carry the "ASAP" moniker), record producers, music video
                directors and fashion designers.
                In August 2012, the collective released the mixtape Lords Never Worry. They released the single
                "Trillmatic" in December 2013, followed by their debut studio album, Cozy Tapes Vol. 1:

                January 18
                The event was launched back in 2015 in tribute to the hip hop group's co-founder A$AP Yams (real name
                Steven Rodriguez), who passed away that year aged 26. Traditionally held on the anniversary of
                Rodriguez' death (January 18), Yams day will be broadcast online in 2021 due to the ongoing coronavirus
                crisis.<br>
